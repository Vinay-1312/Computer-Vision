# Real-Time Mask Detection with CNN and OpenCV

## Overview

This project is a real-time mask detection system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It can process live video feeds from a webcam, making it a valuable tool for applications such as health and safety monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time mask detection in webcam video feeds.
- Pre-trained CNN model for mask detection.
- Easy-to-use, with the potential for customization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the mask detection system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt))
- Haar Cascade classifier XML file for face detection (included or downloadable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mask-detection.git
   cd mask-detection
